# test-yourself 

This is my website about testing your knowledge. 

# What is the problem?
It was a personal problem, 
And it might be a problem for some people to confirm information.

# How did I solve the problem?
Here came the idea of ​​creating a website that contains tests, and from these tests,
People can test what they know.


# What difficulties did I face in solving the problem?
The problem I had with the code was that they were somewhat irregular, 
and the variable names were still somewhat expressive, 
and it was difficult for me to add the feature of adding tests from the user.

# How did I solve the difficulties?
I had to use AI to solve the problem of variable names, 
And I did not know how to add this feature, 
or add tests from the user.

# What technology is used on the site?
Three programming languages ​​were used:

1 - HTML for pages.   2- JavaScript for interaction and movement.  3- CSS for It formats the page.
